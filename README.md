# NeuralLedger: Decentralized Financial Ledger Powered by Neural Networks

NeuralLedger is a cutting-edge Python-based project that explores the intersection of decentralized ledger technology and artificial intelligence. It aims to create a more efficient, secure, and intelligent financial system by leveraging neural networks to enhance traditional blockchain functionalities. This project is a research and development effort to investigate how AI can optimize consensus mechanisms, predict transaction patterns, and bolster security in a decentralized finance (DeFi) context.

The core concept behind NeuralLedger is to integrate a neural network as an active component within the ledger's operation. Instead of solely relying on traditional consensus algorithms like Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake, NeuralLedger incorporates a neural network to analyze transaction data, identify potential anomalies, and dynamically adjust the consensus protocol's parameters. This adaptive approach allows the ledger to self-optimize based on real-time network conditions and evolving security threats. The project is not intended as a production-ready blockchain but serves as a platform for experimentation and innovation in the field of AI-enhanced decentralized ledgers.

NeuralLedger offers several potential advantages over conventional blockchain systems. Firstly, the integrated neural network can provide improved fraud detection capabilities by identifying suspicious transactions with greater accuracy. Secondly, it can optimize resource allocation by dynamically adjusting block sizes and transaction fees based on network congestion and predicted demand. Thirdly, the system can potentially enhance security by detecting and mitigating denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and other malicious activities. This research project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating AI to enhance the performance, security, and adaptability of decentralized ledgers, paving the way for future innovation in the DeFi landscape.

### Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Consensus Mechanism:** A custom consensus algorithm that integrates a neural network to analyze transaction data and dynamically adjust consensus parameters, potentially leading to faster confirmation times and reduced energy consumption. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and trained on simulated transaction data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** A neural network trained to identify anomalous transaction patterns, flagging potentially fraudulent activities for further investigation. This feature uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to analyze transaction sequences and identify deviations from expected behavior.
*   **Dynamic Block Size Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the block size based on network congestion and predicted transaction volume, optimizing throughput and minimizing transaction fees. This is achieved using a reinforcement learning agent that monitors network metrics and adjusts the block size accordingly.
*   **Secure Transaction Validation:** Enhanced transaction validation using AI to detect and prevent double-spending attacks and other security vulnerabilities. This includes a graph neural network (GNN) analyzing transaction dependencies to identify potential conflicts.
*   **Modular Architecture:** A modular design that allows for easy integration of new features and algorithms, facilitating future research and development efforts. The core components are implemented as independent Python modules with well-defined interfaces.
*   **Simulation Environment:** A built-in simulation environment for testing and evaluating different configurations and algorithms, allowing researchers to experiment with different parameters and scenarios. This uses a discrete-event simulation framework to model the network behavior.

### Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the entire project due to its rich ecosystem of libraries for data science and machine learning.
*   **TensorFlow:** A powerful open-source machine learning framework used for building and training the neural networks.
*   **NumPy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
*   **Pandas:** A data analysis and manipulation library used for handling and processing transaction data.
*   **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used for creating a simple API to interact with the ledger.
*   **SQLite:** A lightweight, serverless database used for storing transaction data and ledger state. (For demonstration purposes. Production systems would require a more robust database)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/NeuralLedger.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd NeuralLedger

3.  Create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv

4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS)
    venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

5.  Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Configuration

NeuralLedger utilizes environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the following variables:

*   `LEDGER_PORT`: The port number for the ledger API (default: 5000).
*   `MODEL_PATH`: The path to the pre-trained neural network model (default: models/anomaly_detection_model.h5). Make sure to train a model and place it in the specified directory, or download a pre-trained one.
*   `TRANSACTION_DATA_PATH`: The path to the transaction data file used for training the model (default: data/transactions.csv).

Example `.env` file:

LEDGER_PORT=5000
MODEL_PATH=models/anomaly_detection_model.h5
TRANSACTION_DATA_PATH=data/transactions.csv

### Usage

1.  **Start the Ledger API:**
    python ledger_api.py

2.  **Interact with the API:**
    The API provides endpoints for submitting transactions, querying the ledger state, and retrieving anomaly detection results.

    *   `POST /transactions`: Submits a new transaction to the ledger. The request body should be a JSON object containing the transaction details (e.g., sender, recipient, amount). Example request:

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sender": "Alice", "recipient": "Bob", "amount": 10}' http://localhost:5000/transactions

    *   `GET /ledger`: Retrieves the current state of the ledger. Example request:

    curl http://localhost:5000/ledger

    *   `GET /anomalies`: Retrieves a list of transactions flagged as anomalous by the neural network. Example request:

    curl http://localhost:5000/anomalies

The `ledger_api.py` file contains detailed documentation on each endpoint. You can also use tools like Swagger or Postman to explore the API.
